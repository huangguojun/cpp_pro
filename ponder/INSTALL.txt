Building Ponder
---------------

The build system used for Ponder is CMake (http://cmake.org/).

Once you have generated the project files / makefiles for your favorite compiler
(please refer to http://cmake.org/ if you do not know how to do it),
you can use them to compile the Ponder binaries.
 
The following targets are defined:
 
(empty)
    builds everything

ponder
    builds the Ponder library

pondertest
    builds the Ponder unit tests

doc
    generates the API documentation in HTML format; on Windows, if the HTML Help Workshop program
    is available, the CHM documentation is generated as well; requires doxygen to be installed

install
    installs all the generated components to the standard path


Installing Ponder
-----------------

There are three ways to install Ponder:
- Running the installer (on Windows and Mac OS X) and following the instructions
- Uncompressing the binary archive to a standard path (C:\Program Files, /usr/local/, ...)
- Using CMake and calling the "install" target (see above)

This will create the following directories:
- <INSTALL_PATH>/bin contains the Ponder binary files
- <INSTALL_PATH>/doc contains the API documentation
- <INSTALL_PATH>/include contains the Ponder header files
- <INSTALL_PATH>/lib contains the Ponder library files
- <INSTALL_PATH>/utils contains various utilities related to Ponder
